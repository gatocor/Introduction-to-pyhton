# Introduction to Python

This is a tutorial for learning python that assumes no prior knowledge of programming. 

This is how the tutorial is structured:

 0. In this part, you will go over the setup of python on your computer and all the associated programs that we may need to program.
 1. to 3. Are devoted to learning the python language structure.
 4. to 6. We will go over a brief overview of different python packages that are very handy for data analysis and science.
 7. This chapter proposes a guided data analysis that will go over the different topics covered in the rest of the tutorial.

The course is intended to be followed in order and is mostly self-contained.

## Additional material

Together with the course folders, we provide two pdf files:

 - **Python Language Cheat Sheet** that has all the basics of the language (what is developed in chapters 1 to 3)
 - **Summary of Used Code in the Tutorial** a non-intensive list of the different topics and functions developed in chapters 4 to 6.

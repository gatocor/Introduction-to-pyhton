    "We do not necessarily need to want all the code to go over the same steps in the code. For that, we use conditionals. The basic structure of a condition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if some_boolean_condition:\n",
    "    #some code\n",
    "elif some_other_boolean_comparison:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    #some code any of the other conditions were fullfilled\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few remarks have to be made:\n",
    " 1. The `if` and `elseif` conditions must be completed with a condition, that is, an expression that is `True` or `False`. It would be good if you have a look at the Comparison, Logical and Membership operators in Cheatsheet.\n",
    " 2. After each condition, we finish with two dots `:`.\n",
    " 3. The `elif` and the `else` are not necessary. You can put them or not in the condition depending on if you need them or not.\n",
    " 4. You can put as many `elif`s as you want, but only one `else`.\n",
    " 5. The code inside the conditions must be spaced with a tab. This will happen every time that you put the `:` in any of the codes. This is compulsory for the code to work correctly. It was a programmatic decision made for the code to be clear.\n",
